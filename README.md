# Introduction
The project focuses on a comprehensive XML processing system for validation, formatting, conversion, and compression. It includes:

Level 1 Operations: Basic tasks like XML validation, formatting, conversion to JSON, minification, compression, and decompression.
Level 2 Operations: Advanced features such as graph-based visualization, social network analysis, user recommendations, and post search.

Level 1 Operations
XML Consistency Checker:
Algorithm: Stack-based validation to identify and fix mismatched tags.

Formatting (Prettifying):
Algorithm: DOM parser for structured formatting.

XML to JSON Conversion:
Algorithm: Recursively parses XML into a JSON-like tree.

Minifying XML:
Algorithm: Line-by-line removal of redundant whitespaces.

Compression:
Algorithm: LZW lossless compression.

Decompression:
Algorithm: Reverses LZW compression.

Level 2 Operations
Graph Representation of XML:
Visualization: Nodes represent users; edges depict relationships.

Network Analysis:

Most Active User:

Most Influential User: 

Mutual Followers:

Suggested Users:
Algorithm: Analyzes mutual connections to suggest friends.

Post Search:
Algorithm: Searches posts by topics or keywords.

# Key Features
  Supports CLI and GUI for user interaction.
  Implements efficient algorithms with clear time and space complexity analysis.
  Advanced visualization and analysis provide insights into XML-based social networks.
